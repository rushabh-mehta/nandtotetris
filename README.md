## Week 1

Coded the following boolean functions in HDL:
1. Not
2. And
3. Or
4. Xor
5. Mux
6. DMux 
7. Not16
8. And16
9. Or16
10. Mux16
11. Or8Way
12. Mux4Way16
13. Mux8Way16
14. DMux4Way
15. DMux8Way

We assume that Nand is the fundamental building block and use it as a starting point by abstracting away the implementation of Nand.<br>
Once we develop a function we can use it to develop another functions (For e.g. once Not is developed it can be used to create And).<br>
