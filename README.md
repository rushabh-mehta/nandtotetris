## Week 1 - [Boolean_logic_functions_1](https://github.com/rushabh-mehta/nandtotetris/tree/master/Boolean_logic_functions_1)
We assume that Nand is the fundamental building block and use it as a starting point by abstracting away the implementation of "Nand".<br>
Once we design a function we can use it to design another functions (For e.g. once "Not" is designed it can be used to create "And").<br>
Designed following boolean functions in HDL:
1. Not
2. And
3. Or
4. Xor
5. Mux
6. DMux 
7. Not16
8. And16
9. Or16
10. Mux16
11. Or8Way
12. Mux4Way16
13. Mux8Way16
14. DMux4Way
15. DMux8Way

## Week 2 - [Arithmetic logic unit_2](https://github.com/rushabh-mehta/nandtotetris/tree/master/Arithmetic_logic_unit_2)
1. Designed a Half Adder, Full Adder and a 16 bit ripple carry adder.
2. Designed an ALU for the 16 bit HACK computer which has the following functionalities.
